# AIPlayer
# Description: The responsbility of this class is to interact with the game by
# deciding a valid move based on a given game state. This class has methods that
# will be implemented by students in Dr. Nuxoll's AI course.
#
# Variables:
#   playerId - The id of the player.
##

    # Description: Creates a new Player
    #
    # Parameters:
    #   inputPlayerId - The id to give the new player (int)
    #   cpy           - whether the player is a copy (when playing itself)

    #   must be placed by the player.  These items are: 1 Anthill on
    #   the player's side; 1 tunnel on player's side; 9 grass on the
    #   player's side; and 2 food on the enemy's side.
    #
    # Parameters:
    #   construction - the Construction to be placed.

    # Return: The coordinates of where the construction is to be placed
